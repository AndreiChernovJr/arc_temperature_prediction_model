# Steel Temperature Prediction Mode

Welcome to the Steel Temperature Prediction Model project! My primary objective was to develop an efficient model that accurately predicts the temperature of steel during the manufacturing process.

## Goals

The model is aimed to help a steel plant, reduce electricity costs and minimize wear and tear on their melting equipment. By accurately predicting the temperature of steel based on various manufacturing process factors, it is possible to optimize the heating process and avoid unnecessary heating of the metal. Additionally, identifying the factors that significantly affect the change in temperature of the alloy will aid in process improvement and cost reduction.

## Data and Process Description

We are equipped with comprehensive data and a detailed description of the production process. The dataset includes information on all heating phases, alloying additions, their quantity and timing, type and amount of wire, time of its addition, and the quantity of gas used to mix the metal.

## Project Target Metric

Our target performance metric for the temperature prediction model is an **MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of <= 6.8 degrees**. Achieving this level of accuracy will ensure the model's reliability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure

- `/data`: This directory contains the raw data used for training and testing the model.
- `arc_model_rus.ipynb`: Here, you can find Jupyter notebook with detailing data exploration, model development, and evaluations used in the project.
- `arc_model_naked_eng.ipynb`: Here is the english version of the projects with a little bit less of explainations but still 

## Get Involved

I value any feedback, contributions and collaborations from the data science community. Whether you are interested in improving the model's performance, conducting further analysis, or suggesting new ideas, feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or reach out to me for discussions.
